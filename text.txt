-React Hook:
    -Hooks are functions in React that allow us to manage state, do changes as per the state, and other React features without using class components. They provide a way to reuse stateful logic across components.

    1. useState() :- It is used to manage and update state.

    2. useEffect() :- It is used for handling side effects during component mount, update, and unmount.


-React Props:-
    -In React, "props" (properties) are a way to pass data from a parent component to child component.
    -Props allows, components to be dynamic and flexible, once they receive different data and render accordingly
